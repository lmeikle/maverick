##### A playground project for a web app & mobile app

The main focus of this project is not what the actual application is but to practice and understand everything that is involved
in creating and releasing an application as a web app and as a mobile app. For example:
- How to support both web app and mobile app in the most efficient way
- Mobile testing farms, and how to debug?
- How to derive a mobile/tablet support matrix
- App store Release process - both Google PlayStore and Apple App Store

Once this is done I shall play with some other things like:
- GraphQL, Apollo 
- PWA
- SSR

### Instructions

`npm install`

`npm start`<br />
Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

`npm build`<br />
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Notes

Initial project setup:<br/>
- Used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and ejected straight away.
- Added prettier 
- Added normalize.css with this reset https://zellwk.com/blog/css-reset/
- I won't be using typescript nor unit tests as this is just a playground project (and practising these are covered by my professional work).

Built a very quick UI:<br/>
- Used grid for responsive layout
- https://react-kawaii.now.sh/ for some quick fun graphics
- Used css-modules for scoped styles (https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
